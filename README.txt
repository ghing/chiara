Images and this theme
=====================

It's probably a good idea to set the maximum width for the "Large" thumbnail size
to 700 under Settings > Media.  This way, selecting this size and inserting
the image into the post will make it fit nicely in the content area of the theme.

the use of images in Wordpress themes.
